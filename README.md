# Brachistochrone-Problem
Use Tensorflow to create deep learning models to model the Brachistochrone Problem

Will need to install matplotlib, numpy and tensorflow for this to work. Program is pretty simple. You can either run in an IDE or just run "python3 brachistochrone_curve.py" for it to begin.
